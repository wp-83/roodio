## �📖 Overview

**Roodio** is a cutting-edge music streaming platform that integrates advanced **Machine Learning** to personalize the listening experience based on user mood and emotion. Unlike traditional streaming services, Roodio employs a dual-stack architecture combining a robust **Laravel Web Application** with a sophisticated **Python-based Deep Learning Pipeline** to analyze, classify, and recommend music that resonates with the user's current emotional state.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Engine

The `machineLearning` module uses a **Hierarchical Multi-Modal Classification** system that branches based on energy level, combining audio signal analysis with NLP-based lyric sentiment analysis.

### 🔥 Pipeline Architecture

The system uses a **3-stage hierarchical pipeline**:

```
Audio Input
    │
    ▼
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Stage 1: Energy Classifier  │  PyTorch Neural Network
│  (YAMNet + RMS + ZCR)        │  → High Energy / Low Energy
└──────────┬───────────────────┘
           │
     ┌─────┴─────┐
     ▼           ▼
┌─────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│ Stage 2A│ │ Stage 2B │
│ (Audio) │ │ (Lyrics) │
│ RF + Meta│ │ BERT     │
│→Angry/  │ │→Sad/     │
│  Happy  │ │  Relaxed │
└─────────┘ └──────────┘
```

1.  **Stage 1 — Energy Classification** (Audio):
    *   **PyTorch NN** (`AudioClassifier`) classifies songs into **High Energy** or **Low Energy**.
    *   Features: **YAMNet** embeddings (mean, std, max) + **RMS** + **ZCR** = 3,074-dimensional vector.
2.  **Stage 2A — High Energy Branch** (Audio-only):
    *   **Random Forest + Meta Classifier** (stacking ensemble) to classify between **Angry** and **Happy**.
3.  **Stage 2B — Low Energy Branch** (Lyrics-based):
    *   **Fine-tuned BERT** to classify between **Sad** and **Relaxed**.

*Libraries: `torch`, `tensorflow_hub`, `transformers`, `librosa`, `scikit-learn`, `mlflow`*

## 💻 Local Setup & Testing

A complete guide to running Roodio on your local machine. Intended for lecturers, reviewers, and developers who want to verify features locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your machine:

| Tool | Version | Notes (Windows Recommended) |
|---|---|---|
| **PHP + MySQL + Composer** | 8.2+ / 8.x | Install **[Laragon](https://laragon.org/download)** (bundles all three) |
| **Node.js** | 20+ | [Download](https://nodejs.org) |
| **Python** | 3.10+ | [Download](https://python.org/downloads) |
| **Git** | Latest | [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

### 2. Quick Start (Automated)

**Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xullfikar/roodio.git
cd roodio
```

**Run the Setup Script:**
```cmd
# Windows (CMD / PowerShell / Double-click)
setup.bat

# Mac / Linux
bash setup.sh
```
*The setup script automatically: installs Python/Composer/NPM dependencies, configures `.env`, runs migrations/seeders, creates storage symlinks, and builds frontend assets.*

**Start the Servers:**
```cmd
# Windows
start.bat

# Mac / Linux
bash start.sh
```

Two servers will start:
*   **Laravel Webapp**: `http://localhost:8000`
*   **Flask ML API**: `http://localhost:7860`

### 3. Local Environment Details

*   **File Uploads**: Stored locally in `webApp/storage/app/public/` (no Azure credentials needed).
*   **Emails/OTP**: Emails are NOT sent. OTP codes are logged in `webApp/storage/logs/laravel.log`.
*   **Database Initial State**: Starts empty (no pre-loaded songs) to save local storage. Admin must upload songs to test the ML API.

### 4. Test Accounts

After the setup script finishes, use these seeded accounts:

| Role | Username | Password |
|---|---|---|
| **User** | `user` | `password` |
| **Admin** | `admin` | `password` |
| **SuperAdmin**| `superadmin`| `password` |

### � Recommended Testing Order

To fully test the application locally, follow this sequence:
1. **Auth**: Test Login, Register (check Laravel log for OTP), and Forgot Password.
2. **Admin Songs**: Login as `admin`, go to Songs, and **upload a few MP3s**. *The Flask ML API will automatically predict the mood.*
3. **Admin Playlists**: Create playlists using the uploaded songs.
4. **User Features**: Login as `user`. Test Home, Mood Filtering, Threads, Socials, and Profile updates.
5. **SuperAdmin**: Login as `superadmin`. Test User Management and Role assignments.
6. **MLOps**: Go back to Admin to check the Model Monitor and Feedback metrics.
