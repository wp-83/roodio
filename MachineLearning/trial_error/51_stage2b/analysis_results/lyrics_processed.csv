1,"You know I don't believe in ghosts Or letting people close I'm good at letting go You kiss my lips until they're colder Think you're in control But I should let you know Well, the good guys don't always get the glory Can't you see the warning signs? I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to Wish this was a love you never felt and you know it's true, know it's true Love me, love me Trust me with that heart of yours Feels so heavy Lying on the bedroom floor I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to Chew you up and spit you out And still you come around So, I can watch you drown Hate when you tell me that you'll wait Like you think that I could change When I've always been this way Well, the good guys don't always get the glory Can't you see the warning signs? I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to Wish this was a love you never felt and you know it's true, know it's true Love me, love me Trust me with that heart of yours Feels so heavy Lying on the bedroom floor I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to I'm haunted by the words you say When I can't say that I feel the same Admit you'll always be alone And baby you should know I'm only gonna ghost I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to Wish this was a love you never felt and you know it's true, know it's true (and you know it's true) Love me, love me Trust me with that heart of yours Feels so heavy Lying on the bedroom floor I can make your life a living hell if I wanted to, wanted to (if I wanted to)"
2,"When I'm away from you I'm happier than ever Wish I could explain it better I wish it wasn't true Give me a day or two To think of something clever To write myself a letter To tell me what to do, mm-mm Do you read my interviews? Or do you skip my avenue? (My avenue) When you (when you) said you were passing through Was I even on your way? I knew when I asked you to (when I asked you to) Be cool about what I was telling you You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you'd do) And I'd end up more afraid Don't say it isn't fair You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable So if you really wanna know When I'm away from you (when I'm away from you) I'm happier than ever (happier than ever) Wish I could explain it better (wish I could explain it better) I wish it wasn't true (wish it wasn't true), mm-hm You call me again, drunk in your Benz Driving home under the influence You scared me to death, but I'm wasting my breath 'Cause you only listen to your fucking friends I don't relate to you I don't relate to you, no 'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty You made me hate this city And I don't talk shit about you on the internet Never told anyone anything bad 'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything And all that you did was make me fucking sad So don't waste the time I don't have And don't try to make me feel bad I could talk about every time that you showed up on time But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did Never paid any mind to my mother or friends So I shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid You ruined everything good Always said you were misunderstood Made all my moments your own Just fucking leave me alone, whoa, yeah"
3,"See it in my face That's the me I can't escape Mm, I've gotta change my ways Ooh, crying to the sky but nobody come down Promises in webs of lies Led me to my own demise Built my house so misaligned Watch it burn from the inside Breathing in the fire one too many lifetimes Say we're on our way To some better days Know we're swimming in deep denial Say I'll come around As you figure out I'm too far to bounce back in time See it in my face That's the me I can't escape Mm, I've gotta change my ways Ooh, crying to the sky but nobody come down Cry, cry, crying to the sky but nobody come down Cry, cry, crying to the sky but nobody come down Fell so far from paradise Walking wires from up so high No, we don't see eye to eye Got us taken by surprise Walkin' side by side right into the high tide Say we're on our way To some better days Know we're swimming in deep denial Say I'll come around As you figure out I'm too far to bounce back in time See it in my face That's the me I can't escape Mm, I've gotta change my ways Ooh, crying to the sky but nobody come down Cry, cry, crying to the sky but nobody come down Cry, cry, crying to the sky but nobody come down Crying to the sky, crying crying to sky, come down Crying to the sky but nobody come down"
4,"I don't wanna lie And you can't tell the truth so It's over I don't love you anymore I needed you to pull me through But you don't care, you bring it right back to you The lonely nights inside my room You're at the bar, drinking 'til your liver's bruised Look at yourself in the mirror Distorted, but I see it clearer Life of the party when you're Crying while you're dancing Spinning in the backseat I guess you got what you want I guess it's not enough Crying while you're dancing You woke up in a stranger's bed And realized you're hanging by the thinnest thread Now you're coming down and falling fast Where you end up, you'll break like you're made of glass Look at yourself in the mirror Distorted, but I see that you're Crying while you're dancing Spinning in the backseat I guess you got what you want I guess it's not enough Crying while you're dancing Look at yourself in the mirror Distorted, but I see that you're Crying while you're dancing Spinning in the backseat Guess you got what you want I guess it's not enough Crying while you're dancing"
5,"I don't wanna talk to you I don't wanna talk to anyone I just wanna be alone I just wanna be scum I just wanna be in my room I just wanna be in my bed I just wanna be numb I just wanna be dead

And I know that you hate it And I know that you're jaded And I know that you're fading And I know that you're waiting For me to come out of my shell For me to come out of my hell For me to come out of my cell But I'm not doing too well

I just wanna be quiet I just wanna be quiet I don't wanna speak I don't wanna think I just wanna be quiet I just wanna be quiet I don't wanna speak I don't wanna think

I don't wanna wake up I don't wanna bake up I don't wanna break up I don't wanna make up I don't wanna fake love I don't wanna take drugs I don't wanna say much I don't wanna stay in touch

And I know that you hate it And I know that you're jaded And I know that you're fading And I know that you're waiting For me to come out of my shell For me to come out of my hell For me to come out of my cell But I'm not doing too well

I just wanna be quiet I just wanna be quiet I don't wanna speak I don't wanna think I just wanna be quiet I just wanna be quiet I don't wanna speak I don't wanna think

Shh... Shh...

I just wanna be quiet I just wanna be quiet I just wanna be quiet I just wanna be quiet"
6,"We were doomed right from the start, I'm sorry And you knew the truth It made me believe in nothing And died inside my heart The dream of a broken memory Deep down inside I wish you were still in love with me

Do you think of me? 'Cause I think of you I never wanted you to let me go Although this love is suicide I think it's better this way 'Cause we hated ourselves 'Cause we loved someone else (Never liked the flowers anyway)

WHY! You stabbed me in the heart without a single sympathy! Now you're dead to me! WHAT WAS NEVER MEANT FOR YOU! WHAT WAS NEVER MEANT FOR YOU! WHAT WAS NEVER MEANT FOR YOU! WHAT WAS NEVER MEANT FOR YOU! 'Cause I'm the one that you played! You gave me a thousand heartbreaks!

Oh, we did it to ourselves We got what we deserved It felt much worse than hell All the words you said they hurt But somewhere deep inside you I think that you could change But even if you did It all ends up the same IT ALL ENDS UP THE SAME!

Do you think of me? 'Cause I think of you I never wanted you to let me go Although this love is suicide I think it's better this way 'Cause we hated ourselves 'Cause we loved someone else

I trusted you! And you made me sick! I was blinded! By innocence! Ignored the signs But now I see the truth That everything I gave WAS NOT MEANT FOR YOU!

WAS NOT MEANT FOR YOU! WAS NOT MEANT FOR YOU! WAS NOT MEANT FOR YOU! It never was! It never will! You'll never be! IT WAS NOT MEANT FOR YOU!"
7,"Mama always told me that I was too naive Gave away my trust for pennies I said don't you worry Didn't think that I'll be Broken down and crying help me Wrecked? Check Heart? In debt All you do is come around Just came here to collect Wrecked? Check Heart? In debt Don't you know that I cried tears of gold for you? I sit here poor for you Collect my pennies and my dimes That's why you love it when I cry Platinum love for you I'd give no less for you Generosity is my enemy So I'm broke and your heart's rich Because of me Know that this is my fault Gave a little too much Knew that this was gonna happen But I'm not gonna lie You can make me cry thousand times I come on in back like What is going on with my head? Wrecked? Check Heart? In debt All you do is come around Just came here to collect Wrecked? Check Heart? In debt Don't you know that I cried tears of gold for you? I sit here poor for you Collect my pennies and my dimes That's why you love it when I cry Platinum love for you I'd give no less for you Generosity is my enemy So I'm broke and your heart's rich Because of me And the worst part is I'd do it all over again No, the worst part is, I know it's never gonna end I keep coming right back like a maniac I keep coming right back like And the worst part is I'd do it all over again No, the worst part is, I know it's never gonna end I keep coming right back like a maniac I cried tears of gold for you I sit here poor for you Collect my pennies and my dimes That's why you love it when I cry Platinum love for you I'd give no less for you Generosity is my enemy So I'm broke and your heart's rich Because of me"
8,"Someone call the doctor, someone call the nurse I'm about to lose it, I'm about to burst I'm seeing colors, I'm seeing stars I think I might've taken it a little too far

My heart is racing, I can't catch my breath I think I might be scaring myself to death I need a distraction, I need a release I need a little bit of inner peace

Oh, oh, oh Here we go, here we go Oh, oh, oh I'm about to blow

Fire alarm, fire alarm Ring the bell, sound the horn Fire alarm, fire alarm Save me from the storm 'Cause I'm burning up, I'm burning up I'm burning up, yeah Fire alarm, fire alarm

I'm walking on a wire, I'm playing with fire I'm dancing on the edge of my desire I'm pushing the limits, I'm breaking the rules I'm acting like a fool, yeah, I'm acting like a fool

Oh, oh, oh Here we go, here we go Oh, oh, oh I'm about to blow

Fire alarm, fire alarm Ring the bell, sound the horn Fire alarm, fire alarm Save me from the storm 'Cause I'm burning up, I'm burning up I'm burning up, yeah Fire alarm, fire alarm

(Fire, fire, fire, fire) (Fire, fire, fire, fire)

It's getting hot in here, it's getting loud I think I'm gonna lose myself in the crowd The smoke is rising, the flames are high I think I'm gonna touch the sky

Fire alarm, fire alarm Ring the bell, sound the horn Fire alarm, fire alarm Save me from the storm 'Cause I'm burning up, I'm burning up I'm burning up, yeah Fire alarm, fire alarm"
9,"I'm a disaster A master of my own catastrophe I'm a walking tragedy I'm a danger A stranger to who I used to be Look what I've become

I'm a loaded gun I'm the setting sun I'm the only one who can undo what I have done

God save me from myself 'Cause I can't rely on anybody else I'm going down, I'm going down I'm digging my own grave And I don't know if I can be saved I'm going down, I'm going down

I'm a monster Imposter in my own skin I'm the chaos from within I'm a liar A fire burning everything Look what I've become

I'm a loaded gun I'm the setting sun I'm the only one who can undo what I have done

God save me from myself 'Cause I can't rely on anybody else I'm going down, I'm going down I'm digging my own grave And I don't know if I can be saved I'm going down, I'm going down

God save me (save me, save me) God save me (save me, save me) God save me from myself God save me (save me, save me) God save me (save me, save me)

God save me from myself 'Cause I can't rely on anybody else I'm going down, I'm going down I'm digging my own grave And I don't know if I can be saved I'm going down, I'm going down"
10,"(Intro) He didn't walk me down no stairs Didn't warn me 'bout them boys who wouldn't care Didn't tell me what a real man sounds like So I fell for the ones that lied just right He never pulled my chair or checked my friends Never showed me what to lose or what to defend So I chased love with an open wound Looking for something I was never introduced to Mama did her best but she can't teach What it feels like when a father speaks So I took every ""I love you"" too deep Even when they only meant it for a week

How was I supposed to know what love looked like? When Daddy never showed me what felt right How was I supposed to set the bar? When I ain't never seen no man fight for my heart Now I'm learning through heartbreak piece by piece Trying to be soft in a world that's been hard on me I ain't bitter, just broken in places you can't see How was I supposed to know? If he ain't teach me

I thought pain was part of being chosen If he stayed then the hurt was worth holding I called settling a sign of love 'Cause I ain't know a man should lift me up I know you're beautiful just 'cause I'm his I know I got you when life don't make sense So I let bare minimum feel like gold 'Cause I ain't know I deserved more to hold Mama raised a queen with a wounded crown Taught me strength but I still let love drag me down 'Cause Daddy never gave me that love one on one So I mistook lust for the real one

How was I supposed to know what love looked like? When Daddy never showed me what felt right How was I supposed to set the bar? When I ain't never seen no man fight for my heart Now I'm learning through heartbreak piece by piece Trying to be soft in a world that's been hard on me I ain't bitter, just broken in places you can't see How was I supposed to know? If he ain't teach me

I needed arms that protected Not ones that neglected Needed truth without games Real love with no pain So now I relearn what I missed Unpacking daddy wounds from every kiss But I promise one day I'll be free Of the love that never covered me How was I supposed to know what love looked like? When my first man left before I learned to fight Now I raise my standards like prayers to the sky For the girl I was who needed to know why I still stumble But now I see The kind of love that was meant for me And I'll teach my daughter what he couldn't show So she'll know"
11,"Everyone tells me, save your money, think about tomorrow, not the world. But I only see today, I live in the now. I buy myself dreams that no one can replace.

Sirens of accounts and savings plans. But I want to dance, not count numbers. Life is short, why wait? I'm spending it on launching rockets.

[Chorus] I'm spending it, I'm spending it. For life, not for a house. [Catatan: Audio terdengar seperti ""Haus"" atau ""Maus"" (slang uang)] No piggy bank can hold me back. I'm spending it, I'm spending it.

They say you'll regret it later. But I want to scatter my days. No tomorrow interests me, only the joy that explodes today.

Laughter, travel, stargazing. Money is paper, let it blow away. I do my thing, you stay here. I follow the rush, not the greed.

[Chorus] I'm spending it, I'm spending it. For the Life, not for a house. No piggy bank can stop me. I'm spending it, I'm spending it."
12,"I think you murder my feelings I think you hurt me for no reason Stab me in the back and then you leave then You say you love me but you don't mean it I think you murder my feelings I think you hurt me for no reason Stab me in the back and then you leave then You say you love me but you don't mean it

I gave you my heart and you broke it I gave you my trust and you stole it I gave you my love and you froze it You acted like you didn't know it You played me like a game, controller You ran me over like a stroller You treat me like I'm a loner But I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier

I'm crying in my room Thinking about you And what we used to do But now we are through I'm crying in my room Thinking about you And what we used to do But now we are through

I think you murder my feelings I think you hurt me for no reason Stab me in the back and then you leave then You say you love me but you don't mean it I think you murder my feelings I think you hurt me for no reason Stab me in the back and then you leave then You say you love me but you don't mean it

(You say you love me but you don't mean it) (You say you love me but you don't mean it)"
13,"I'm not gonna lie I was gonna call you tonight Burnin' up inside Thinkin' about the time That you were mine

I'm not gonna lie I was gonna drive to your house Burnin' out the lights Sleepin' on the couch Until you found me

'Cause I remember how you tasted I remember how you felt I remember how you looked at me When you took off my belt I remember how we wasted Every moment that we dealt I remember how you looked at me When I began to melt

And now I'm covered in these tattoos And I'll never get them off 'Cause they remind me of you And who we were when we were lost Yeah, now I'm covered in these tattoos And I'll never get them off 'Cause they remind me of you And everything we lost

Covered in these tattoos Covered in these tattoos Covered in these tattoos Covered in these tattoos

I'm not gonna lie I was gonna call you tonight (Call you tonight) Burnin' up inside Thinkin' about the time That you were mine (That you were mine)

'Cause I remember how you tasted I remember how you felt I remember how you looked at me When you took off my belt I remember how we wasted Every moment that we dealt I remember how you looked at me When I began to melt

And now I'm covered in these tattoos And I'll never get them off 'Cause they remind me of you And who we were when we were lost Yeah, now I'm covered in these tattoos And I'll never get them off 'Cause they remind me of you And everything we lost

Covered in these tattoos Covered in these tattoos Covered in these tattoos Covered in these tattoos"
14,"Sick of the nightmare Sick of the flashbacks Sick of the enemy that's staring from the looking glass Sick of the silence Sick of the violence Sick of the war inside my head that keeps on rioting

I've been faking a smile For a long, long time Damn, it's been a while Since I felt fine

I'm not okay And it's about time I said it I'm not okay I'm not afraid to admit it I'm not okay And I'm not gonna lie no more I'm not gonna hide no more I'm not okay (And that's okay)

Sick of the pressure Sick of the expectations Sick of the way I feel like I need a vacation From my own mind From my own life From the person that I've become in everybody's eyes

I've been faking a smile For a long, long time Damn, it's been a while Since I felt fine

I'm not okay And it's about time I said it I'm not okay I'm not afraid to admit it I'm not okay And I'm not gonna lie no more I'm not gonna hide no more I'm not okay

Take a breath Take a look in the mirror It's okay to not be okay It's okay to not be okay Take a breath Take a look in the mirror It's okay to not be okay It's okay to be...

I'm not okay And it's about time I said it I'm not okay I'm not afraid to admit it I'm not okay And I'm not gonna lie no more I'm not gonna hide no more I'm not okay (And that's okay)

I'm not okay No, I'm not okay I'm not okay"
15,"Talk is cheap and I've been sold A lie that's worth its weight in gold I think I've lost my mind Tracing back the lines Of every time I let you in And let you break me down again I think I've had enough I'm calling out your bluff

And I know, and I know, and I know That you're never gonna change And I know, and I know, and I know That you'll always stay the same

'Cause you were everything, everything to me But now you're dead to me, dead to me I gave you everything, everything I had But you just treated me bad, treated me bad So go and say what you want 'Cause I am done with you Yeah, you were everything, everything to me But now you're dead to me

(Dead to me) (Dead to me)

I remember when we used to be So inseparable, you and me But that was just a dream Or so it seems 'Cause now I see the real you And everything you put me through The mask is falling off And I'm the one who's lost

And I know, and I know, and I know That you're never gonna change And I know, and I know, and I know That you'll always stay the same

'Cause you were everything, everything to me But now you're dead to me, dead to me I gave you everything, everything I had But you just treated me bad, treated me bad So go and say what you want 'Cause I am done with you Yeah, you were everything, everything to me But now you're dead to me

You can't love anyone, 'cause that would mean you had a heart I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't 'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand I've made some real big mistakes But you make the worst one look fine I should've known it was strange You only come out at night I used to think I was smart But you made me look so naÃ¯ve The way you sold me for parts As you sunk your teeth into me, oh Bloodsucker, famefucker Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire"

22,"I've got a bad taste in my mouth From all the words I can't spit out And I've been choking on the doubt That I'm never gonna make it out

I see the patterns in my blood Like a disease I can't outrun Is this who I'm supposed to be? Or is it just hereditary?

(Oh, oh) Is it just hereditary? (Oh, oh)

I built these walls to keep me safe But now they're standing in my way I'm haunted by the ghost of yesterday And I can't seem to break away

It's in my veins, it's in my soul A broken part I can't control I try to hide, I try to fight But it keeps me up at night

I see the patterns in my blood Like a disease I can't outrun Is this who I'm supposed to be? Or is it just hereditary?

(Oh, oh) Is it just hereditary? (Oh, oh)

Maybe I'm destined to fall apart Maybe it's written in the stars Or maybe I can change the end And learn to start again

23,"I tried my best to say That it wasn't my fault But I will make mistakes And I will always fall down And blame myself For when there's no one around to Save me From falling down

I fucking hate myself because of you! And there was nothing else that I could do I tried to see What's good in you But I can't see what's good in myself

A hypocrite! A piece of shit! A fucking liar! That's all I am! Just pull the pin! And I can see How you could... Never forgive me!

I severed all our ties So you don't have to watch me die This hurts me more than it hurts you I never liked to face the truth But I can't just go and pretend it'll be okay 'Cause it's not okay! (No, I'm not okay!)

Filled with regret! I'm so ashamed! The way I looked at you! In all of your pain! When I was afraid! Of who you'd become! You showed your true colors! And I had to run away!

I hope it hurts to know! But I'm always on the go And it's better this way So leave me the way

This hurts me more than it hurts you I never liked to face the truth But I can't just go and pretend it'll be okay 'Cause it's not okay! (No, I'm not okay!)

We have all failed as God's creation And I am haunted by my mistakes Do not pity me for I am a broken shell But how could you blame me for trying to protect myself? I was only afraid!

I always win the game of losing people that I love And I feel like I'm the best at fucking everything up And I'm so sorry! But I know that you will never forgive me And that's okay

I never thought my heart could ever be so fucking numb And all I wanted was someone to show me that I'm loved But even that seems so... far away! (Far away!)

I made mistakes Every day I'm so ashamed Wish that I could take it back But this poison is incurable I have spent my life trying to make everything right I forget about myself Did I give for nothing's love? Oh!

My guilt is violently killing me! My guilt is violently killing me! My guilt is violently killing me! My guilt! My guilt! My guilt is fucking killing me!"
24,"We've been chasing ghosts In the dark You said love's not easy I know that part But even when the light fades out Of view I don't want to give up Not as long as it's you

You're the quiet in my chaos, the ache that feels right (The ache that feels right) Even when we're breaking I'll hold onto tight I don't want to give up as long as it's you Each wound that we've been through I'd fight the storm if it's you

If all that fades I'll stay the same and scream Your name through rain Won't give up, not as long as it's you Just hope you feel it too

Some nights feel stranger Lost in the haze Some days love feels too heavy to save But even when the pain floods Me and you I don't want to give up Not as long as it's you

I've seen the end, I felt the fall But your name still burns beneath it all I don't want to give up As long as it's you, each wound that we've been through I'd fight the storm if it's you

If all that fades, I'll stay the same and scream Your name through rain Won't give up, not as long as it's you Just hope you feel it too

If it all burns down I'll stay in the fire 'Cause loving you is the only thing I desire Even if the stars stop shining through I'll still choose this life with you

I don't want to give up as long as it's you Each wound that we've been through I'd fight the storm if it's you If all that fades, I'll stay the same and scream Your name through rain Won't give up, not as long as it's you Just hope you feel it too"
25,"Hmm-hmm-hmm, oh
That's how life goes
Yeah, that's how life goes
Yeah, the more quiet the night, the louder my thoughts
On my hand I tatted a cross
I find God whenever I'm lost
I humble myself, he's the one I'll call
If you see me defeated, just know that I fought
There's a reason they need me to be in the dark
My potential broke levels that no body saw
I'm special, won't settle for less I'm a star
Whoa, I'm not the typical rapper
The message in my music actually matters
My music will live after I'm in a casket
I'm never gon' quit 'til I'm movin' the masses
Imagine a life where I lacked all my passion
And never poured my heart and soul into rappin'
I'd be miserable wondering what would happen
If I wouldn't chase my dream, that thought does damage, it's funny
Kids from high school who kept dissing
All work at McDonald's, I'll take a McChicken
Can't expect the blind to ever see your vision
You peaked in high school, now you hate that I'm winning
I'm grinning, this isn't me bragging or gloating
This is a reminder, my drive hasn't broken
Devoted still going even at my lowest
Opponents stay hoping I'll fail when I'm chosen
These moments I'm livin' are real, they don't care how I feel
I got wounds that don't heal and I need love still
Why you runnin' for the hills? You won't answer me, I get it
Let's be honest, I am gifted, I know when energy's shifting
I know when you're acting different, I know you think I don't listen
I know you think I'm too driven, but that's somethin' that you should know
A mediocre life's a joke, I'd rather have family close
I'd rather be inside a home, I'd rather have someone to hold
I'd rather smile when I'm old, if I have that, but I'm broke
Then tell me who's really broke?
While I'm absent, I've grown
But now I'm comin' for the throne (throne)
Spent so many nights feelin' like I'm inadequate
Letting my mind tell me I should be sad again
Despite my life going right, I felt stagnant
Realized the time passing by can't be had again
So I got up and my drive was my catalyst
Manifested the life I've been imagining
I put the time in, this isn't an accident
The rise of me, yo, I'm feelin' immaculate
Haven't been home, I been in my mind
Don't you know we're just a matter of time
One minute you're livin', the next one you die
There's some things that money simply can't buy
See you may have eyes but you can not see
You live in a box so you are not free
Life's a gift from God that you can not keep
Going against the odds, the best way to think
Believing in me is all I can do
Surrounded by haters doubters and fools
Who will come around when I got the jewels
They're here when I win but bail when I lose
It's funny how money makes change out of people
And paper dictates who's unworthy or equal
In my eyes, that's the definition of evil
When materials is the only way to see you
I need you to hear me and take this to heart
You are the reason, you are where you are
Awaken your mind and follow the stars
One day they'll align and take you afar
I know life is hard, the pressure is heavy
When nobody knows that you're feelin' unsteady
But still have to show up and feelin' so empty
You're never rewarded, there's never confetti
There's envy and anger, never been stranger
To a life where it feels like your being anchored
Livin' inside of your mind feelin' dangerous
Watchin' 'em fall, but you can not save 'em
You can't save yourself, you're livin' in hell
The smile on your face makes it hard to tell
And there's no one who could help
The lonely journey to yourself"

[Verse 2] In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone 'Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3] And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dared Disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4] ""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you"" But my words, like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence

[Verse 5] And the people bowed and prayed To the neon god they made And the sign flashed out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls"" And whispered in the sound of silence"

62,"You're broke as a joke
Plus your credit's low, you couldn't pay your telephone

You're drunk as a skunk
Foolish at the party, then you threw up all your lunch

Remember back in'95, when they were happy you're alive

Now you gotta make sure their expenses are all paid on time
Shift my paradigm
Ooh, I'm drifting from my innocence
I wanna be a kid again
Ooh, I wonder about it sometimes
Leave the bullshit all behind

High all the time
Doin' lines in the bathroom, this place is a vacuum
I can't breathe
IfI could rewind, I'd live in isolation
Then a late beach vacation
But that's just me
Remember back in'95, when they were happy you're alive

Now you gotta make sure their expenses are all paid on time
Shift my paradigm
Ooh, I'm drifting from my innocence
I wanna be a kid again
Ooh, I cry about it all the time
It took away my paradigm
Ooh, I'm drifting from my innocence
I wanna be a kid again
Ooh, I cry about it all the time
It took away my paradigm
I wrote this when I was broke as a joke
Now I float, now I rise like a rose
Jalen Rose, Derrick Rose
Guoci flowers in my robe
I get showered, they throw roses at my feet
Those are flowers I don't keep
No flour, nothing sweet
Might go vegan, gluten-free
Really free, independent, it's just me and my G's
John Rose, Bernie Rose, Miley Rose, Phony Rose
Raleigh Rose, Jose Rose, Sean be rising on these hos
We'll be rising 'til the day that I'm dying
This I know, this I know, this I know

Yeah, let's take it bøck
I remember we were Kobe and Shaq
Heartbroken but still intact, in pieces but still at peace
Got pieces to keep the peace
I could tell you who I really is
Matthew fucking Sean
I've been rappin' since we parked cycles on mama's lawn
Commas ever now seen common street pooms
Got my palms itchin', and that pinky glistenin""in the charm
Got the ball spinning, I smoke tall trees to sort of soften tension
These bold white tees but might cost different
There's a white tee, but it cost living
Life's Guoci, the Gucci ones tinted
I never watched, niggas been known
(Matthew fucking Sean)
(l been rapping since we parked cycles on mama's lawn)"

I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead
With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
They all said it would fade, but again and again
I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
I've been so busy
But now that I'm alone
Where did you go?
Tell me why
Why can't you live at home tonight and stay with me inside?
It's nice
Please, I wanna see what we would be if you were by my side
Make me feel lonely, soon
You might not know me, I wish I could lie
But I can't deny
My chest is hurting, my feet can't fall out of bed
I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead
With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread
They all said it would fade, but again and again
I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love
I'm hurting, I'm stuck in my bed
I don't know where to go, so I'll lay here instead

You've given me warmth Wrap your arms around me You say, ""Baby, don't worry, I'm here"" You've given me love, yes, it's so pure It makes me wanna grow old with you Tell you, girl, I love you too

If I went and hurt my body, baby Would you love me the same? I can feel all my bones coming back And I'm craving motion Mama never really learned how to live by herself It's a curse And it's growing You're a pond and I'm an ocean Oh, all my emotions Feel like explosions when you are around And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you I need you here to stay I broke all my bones that day I found you Crying at the lake Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh, and if I could take it all back I swear that I would pull you from the tide Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa I said no, I said no Listen close, it's a no The wind is a-pounding on my back And I found hope in a heart attack Oh, at last, it is past Now I've got it, and you can't have it Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you I need you here to stay I broke all my bones that day I found you Crying at the lake Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden? Oh And if I could take it all back I swear that I would pull you from the tide Darling, when I'm fast asleep I've seen this person watching me Saying, ""Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"" 'Cause there is something, and there is nothing There is nothing in between And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer Watching over me, he's singing ""She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"" He's singing, ""She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"" Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you I need you here to stay Broke all my bones that day I found you Crying at the lake Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?

75,Between people Between the wind Each person has their own desires Painted together When it becomes firm enough to stand on Then it becomes my world My small heart And the good things in it Break and harden Melt and fall away And only then can I see my eternity Love between people Everyone gathers together Hoping for eternity If we bury our bodies and hearts Then our world becomes perfect With love With love My small heart Like small waves inside Break and push towards you Melting and falling away And only then can I see my eternity
76,"Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I promise that one day I'll feel fine

And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee with the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it
Don't know how long I'd stay for
It's okay, I'll knock on your door
Won't you come down and get me?
I like it when you hold me tight
You make me feel nice
The green in your eyes
Makes me feel warm inside

I had to find you, tell ya I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions

Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Runnin' in circles, chasin' our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy

79,"Take it
If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She always has trouble falling asleep
And she likes to cuddle while under the sheets
She loves Pop songs and dancing, and bad trash TV
There's still a few other things
She loves love notes and babies
And likes giving gifts
Has a hard time accepting
A good compliment
She loves her whole family
And all of her friends
So if you're the one she lets in
Take it
If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her like that
Kiss her with passion as much as you can
Run your hands through her hair whenever she's sad
And when she doesn't notice how pretty she is
Tell her over and over so she never forgets
Take it
If she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her like that
She'll love you if you love her like that
She'll love you if you love her
She'll love you if you love her like that
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
She'll love you
She'll love you
She'll love you
She'll love you if you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her like that"
80,"And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to Heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't wanna go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken

81,"Some nights, I don't even sleep
Chest tight with anxiety
Stay up to see the moon leave the sky
Some days, I'm not even me
Same old insecurities
They tell me there's something going wrong inside
I've been there, down that road
When you need me, I'll be here to let you know
It's gonna be okay
Everyone needs a bad day
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone
And call me whenever you're feeling lonely
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone
Break down 'cause you're breaking through
No sky is forever blue
Things bloom whenever they've seen the rain
Your thoughts lie, but I know the truth (I know the truth)
The best days are ahead of you (ahead of you)
Tomorrow isn't your yesterday (oh-oh)
I've been there, down that road
When you need me, I'll be here to let you know

You're not alone, you're not alone
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone (pick up the phone)
You're not alone, you're not alone (pick up, pick up the phone)
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone (you're not, you're not alone)
You're not alone, you're not alone, you're not alone

82,"I remember the day
Even wrote down the date, that I fell for you (mmhm)
And now it's crossed out in red
But I still can't forget if I wanted to
And it drives me insane
Think I'm hearing your name, everywhere I go
But it's all in my head
It's just all in my head
But you won't see me break, call you up in three days
Or send you a bouquet, saying, ""It's a mistake""
Drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne
And you know
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
Here's your perfect
My best was just fine
How I tried, how I tried to be great for you
I'm flawed by design and you love to remind me
No matter what I do
But you won't see me break, call you up in three days
Or send you a bouquet, saying, ""It's a mistake""
Drink my troubles away, one more glass of champagne
And you know
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing
But now I know a perfect way to let you go
Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
And you're the first to say you want the best thing

Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
Say yeah, yeah, yeah

From your kiss
You're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me
At arm's length don't work
You try to push me out

Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out
I win
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

I get quiet when there's no one else around?
Me and you and awkward silence

I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same
Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
""She's so perfect, "" blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
What's a girl to do?
Lying on my bed, staring into the blue
Unrequited, terrifying
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest
I'm telling you today
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?

Thought you'd always stay

Think I have to go
Walking all alone

Wanted to be with you
Wanted to make it through
But did you?
I swear I knew
Now that it's over, you'll blame it all on me
I know I should be bitter, but baby
Right now I'm bittersweet
I'm getting over what you put me through
And I'd say I'm done crying, but baby
I don't lie like you do
You do
You do
Right now I'm bittersweet
Ooh
Mm
Right now I'm bittersweet
One day, I'll wake up sad
But go to bed so glad
Knowing you know what you could've had
Now I'm choosing me
It wasn't so easy
God forbid forever on my knees
Know you won't make it right
Can't look me in the eyes
Good for you
I always think I knew
Now that it's over, you'll blame it all on me
I know I should be bitter, but baby
Right now I'm bittersweet

I don't lie like you do
You do
You do

Mm
Right now I'm bittersweet
I lay awake thinkin', ""How did I let you go?""
Gettin' away unscathed for so damn long
I got away, took my time, I'm okay alone
And you stay knowing you forever know how hard I tried with you, oh

87,"Hey, this is a story I hate
And telling it might make me break
But I'll tell it anyway
This chapter's about
How you said there was nobody else
Then you got up and went to her house
You guys always left me out
I still have the letter you wrote
When you told me that I was the only girl
You'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?
You check in and out
Of my heart like a hotel
And she must be perfect, oh well
I hope you both go to hell
I still have the letter you wrote
When you told me that I was the only girl
You'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are (here we are)
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart? (Heart)
How could you be so reckless?
How could you be so reckless?
How could you be so reckless with someone's heart?
Hey, this is a story I hate
But I told it to cope with the pain
I'm so sorry if you can relate"
88,"Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's headin' for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Going out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you"

The way we feel
They just don't trust
What they can't explain
I know we're different
But deep inside us
We're not that different at all
And you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know?
We need each other
To have, to hold
They'll see in time
I know
When destiny calls you
You must be strong
I may not be with you
But you've got to hold on
They'll see in time
I know
We'll show them together

Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on

So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

I wanna love like you made me feel

We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine

Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me I said I was busy
That was a lie
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool
But I'm not the baddest
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now
You know the last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about 8 or 9
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie
Every eldest daughter
Was the first lamb to the slaughter
So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire
But I'm not the baddest, and this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors, smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now
We lie back
A beautiful, beautiful time lapse
Ferris wheels, kisses and lilacs
And things I said were dumb
'Cause I thought that I'd never find that beautiful, beautiful life that
Shimmers that innocent light back
Like when we were young
Every youngest child felt
They were raised up in the wild
But now you're home
'Cause I'm not the baddest
And this isn't savage
And I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now
Never gonna break that vow
Never gonna leave you now, now
I'm never gonna leave you now"
97,"One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream, stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh, oh oh
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched aurora borealis green
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true
Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream, stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh, oh oh
I (I) can't (can't) speak afraid to jinx it
I (I) don't (don't) even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?
Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)
Weird but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream, stars by the pocketful (flying in a dream)
You wanting me tonight feels impossible (you wanting me)
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach (snow on the beach)
Like snow on the beach (flying in a dream)
Like snow on the beach (you wanting me)
Like snow, oh
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach (it's comin' down, it's comin' down)
(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)
(Like snow on the beach)
(It's comin' down, it's comin' down, it's comin' down, it's comin' down)

98,"Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don't know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closing in
And the devil's knocking at my door, whoa
Out of my mind, how many times
Did I tell you I'm no good at being alone?
Yeah, it's taking a toll on me, trying my best to keep
From tearing the skin off my bones, don't you know
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me, mm-hmm
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me
Problematic
Problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habit's hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know, I could do it on my own, but I want
That real full moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
Problem is, when I'm with you, I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darling, please, oh
I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me, mm-hmm
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm
I'm falling apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me, mm-hmm
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me"

I know a place
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face

Something to do while we try to recall how we met

Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten
About you?

You and I (Don't let go)
We're alive (Don't let go)
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait (Don't let go)
And pretend (Don't let go, oh)
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end (In the end)

100,"Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, ""If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?""
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinkin' maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving
Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here""
I said, ""There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year""
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving
I'm not moving, I'm not moving
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you won't mean to, but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me (find that you're missing me)
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be (where on this Earth I could be)
Thinkin' maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (to the place that we'd meet)
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
'cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me
(I'm not moving) and your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
(I'm not moving) thinkin' maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
(I'm not moving) and you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move"

You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than the blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
Wish I were Heather
Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than the blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?

With your hands between your thighs
Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

Days pull you down just like a sinking ship
Floating is getting harder
But tread the water, child, and know that meanwhile
Rises the moon
Days pull you up just like a daffodil
Uprooted from its garden
They'll tell you what you owe, but know even so
Rises the moon
You'll be visited by sleep
I promise you that soon the autumn comes
To steal away each dream you keep
Breathe, breathe, breathe"

Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you
There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you, won't you, be the one I'll always know?
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
You're the only one who knows to slow it down
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you
And I'll look after you
If ever there was a doubt
My love, she leans into me
This most assuredly counts
She says most assuredly
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you
After you
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh
It's always half and never whole
You've begun to feel like home, yeah
But what's mine is yours to leave or take
What's mine is yours to make your own
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh-oh, oh-ooh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-ooh-oh, oh, oh"
198,"Take you like a drug
I taste you on my tongue
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst time
You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me something that I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you'll do for a friend
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues
I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out
Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too
If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too"
199,"Hope you don't regret it
I pushed a lot back but I can't forget it
We never got the credit
Nobody seemed to hear us, but we said it
Neither of us planned it
And for a long time I took it all for granted
I really thought we had it
But at the time it was more than I could manage, so
If we can leave it all behind us
And meet in-between
It would get me so
High all the time
High all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?
Wish I didn't doubt it
I wish I never ever told you all about it
But I just had to let you know
I never meant to hurt you though
I had all my motives
I didn't know they wouldn't mix with your emotions
I just had to reach my goals
Never knew I needed you though, so
If we can agree to disagree, yeah
Then keep on reaching
It would get you so
High all the time
High all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?
High all the time
High all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?
Used to stick together
You're my best friend, I'll love you forever
We could be the greatest
It doesn't matter if we're never rich or famous
High all the time
High all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?
If you can just let me know if it's okay
To call you when I'm lonely"
200,"There's a quiet pull beneath my feet
A silent hunger in the deep
It whispers softly, calling me
Into the circle, endlessly
And every day it grows, it grows
A tide that pulls the light below
I try to run, but still it knows
My name, my name
Oh, the black hole keeps turning
Keeps pulling at my burning
Heart, heart,
Trying to tear me apart
But I won't fall forever
I'm holding to the tether
I'll rise, I'll rise
I won't be swallowed by its night
I feel the shadows on my skin
Routine like chains that pull me in
The hollow place that spins and spins
As if it's all I'll ever live
But I can hear a distant drum
A thundering that says ""become""
A spark that tells me I'm not done
Not yet, not yet
Oh, the black hole keeps turning
Keeps pulling at my burning
Heart, heart,
Trying to tear me apart
But I won't fall forever
I'm holding to the tether
I'll rise, I'll rise
I won't be swallowed by its night
I push the gravity away
Break through the dark, a silver ray
And for a moment I can say
I'm free, I'm free
Oh, the black hole stops turning
Can't pull against the yearning
Inside, inside
My soul refusing to hide
No, I won't fall forever
I cut away the tether
I rise, I rise
I'm stepping out into the light
I rise... I rise...
Out of the ordinary night"
